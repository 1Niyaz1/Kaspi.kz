# ⚽ Transfermarkt Data Analysis (abandoned)  

## 📌 Project Description  

The **Transfermarkt Data Analysis** project is planned to analyze football player transfer data from Transfermarkt. The goal is to build a comprehensive system that will evaluate player values, identify trends in transfer fees, and offer insights into factors influencing player valuations. This project will utilize various data analysis techniques and visualizations to understand the dynamics of player transfers in professional football.  

The dataset is expected to include player information such as transfer fees, market value, age, nationality, position, and historical performance. By analyzing these attributes, I aim to uncover patterns and provide actionable insights to better understand the factors behind player market values.

## 📅 Project Plan  

### 📥 1. Data Collection  
- 🔍 Scrape data from Transfermarkt, including player market values, transfer histories, and other relevant attributes.  
- 🛠️ Clean and preprocess the data to handle missing values, duplicates, and irrelevant information.  

### 📊 2. Exploratory Data Analysis  
- 📈 Perform an initial analysis to understand the dataset, such as the distribution of market values, age ranges of players, and transfer fee trends.  
- 🎨 Visualize key variables using plots like histograms, bar charts, and scatter plots to explore relationships within the data.  

### 💰 3. Analysis of Transfer Fees and Player Values  
- 🔎 Investigate the relationship between player attributes (e.g., age, position, nationality, league) and their market value or transfer fee.  
- 🏆 Identify the top players with the highest market values and transfer fees and analyze the factors contributing to these valuations.  

### 🤖 4. Modeling and Predictions  
- 🧠 Develop a predictive model that will estimate future player market values based on available features such as player performance, age, nationality, and league.  
- ⚙️ Use machine learning techniques to improve the accuracy of value predictions.  

### 🏁 5. Conclusions
