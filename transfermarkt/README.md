# Transfermarkt Data Analysis(In Progress)

## Project Description

The **Transfermarkt Data Analysis** project aims to analyze football player transfer data from Transfermarkt. The goal is to build a comprehensive system that can evaluate the value of players, identify trends in transfer fees, and offer insights into factors that influence player valuations. This project uses various data analysis techniques and visualizations to understand the dynamics of player transfers in professional football.

The dataset includes player information such as their transfer fee, market value, age, nationality, position, and historical performance. By analyzing these attributes, we aim to uncover patterns and provide actionable insights that can help in understanding the factors behind player market values.

## Project Plan

### 1. Data Collection  
   - Scrape data from Transfermarkt, including player market values, transfer histories, and other relevant attributes.  
   - Clean and preprocess the data to handle missing values, duplicates, and irrelevant information.

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis  
   - Perform an initial analysis to understand the dataset, such as the distribution of market values, age ranges of players, and transfer fee trends.  
   - Visualize key variables using plots like histograms, bar charts, and scatter plots to explore relationships within the data.

### 3. Analysis of Transfer Fees and Player Values  
   - Investigate the relationship between player attributes (e.g., age, position, nationality, league) and their market value or transfer fee.  
   - Identify the top players with the highest market values and transfer fees, and analyze the factors contributing to these valuations.

### 4. Modeling and Predictions  
   - Develop a predictive model to estimate player market values based on available features such as player performance, age, nationality, and league.

### 5. Conclusions
